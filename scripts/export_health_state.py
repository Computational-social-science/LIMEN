"""Export the live state the dashboard renders.

WHY A SEPARATE EXPORTER
    Browsers block `fetch()` on file:// documents, so a dashboard cannot read a JSON file next to
    itself. The state is therefore written as a JS global in `viz/state.js`, which `<script src>`
    loads without the CORS restriction. The JSON is written too, for anything that wants to parse it.

WHY IT IS CALLED BY THE HEALTH CHAIN
    A dashboard that is exported by hand desynchronises the first time someone forgets. `health.py`
    calls this at the end of preflight, status and validate, so whatever the chain just concluded is
    what the page shows.

WHY NOTHING IS EVER FABRICATED
    If a source is missing, the panel says so. A dashboard that invents plausible content is worse
    than a blank one because it gets believed -- and this project has already spent GPU time on
    numbers that looked real.

WHAT THE PAGE CAN AND CANNOT SHOW
    The harness prints nothing during `fit()`, so a running arm has no step-level progress to display.
    What exists is: GPU state, elapsed time against a measured budget, and the presence of artifacts
    written between training and evaluation. The exporter reports exactly those, and a phase field
    says which one is in play rather than implying a percentage it cannot know.
